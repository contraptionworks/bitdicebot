# Blades in the Dicebot

[Modding this to make partial successes only on 5 instead of 4-5. Would also like to add a second pool of corruption dice that contribute to successes, but cause problems if two or more 1s or 6s are rolled on them.]

A Discord bot custom made for Blades in the Dark.

Simpler syntax and clearer results.  
Handles 0d, critical results and resistances rolls.  
Also has a cute name.

Recommended alongside [Blades in The Glossary](https://github.com/jordanclarkedev/Blades-in-the-Glossary/blob/master/README.md), and also can work alongside Sidekick.

If you've found any issues or improvements it could use, file a bug!

## How to install

Just follow this link:
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=689624467680395296&scope=bot&permissions=32768

The link will prompt you to authorize the bot on a server. It needs permissions to allow embeds (makes things look pretty). Once the bot's authorized, you'll see it in the Member List. In a public channel just type any of the commands outlined below and the bot will answer with a dice roll.
